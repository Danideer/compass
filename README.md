Project Compass
===============

**Description:** Project Compass is a public repository with the objective of being an instrument to discover how to view the world and figure out how to express it as concisely and honestly as possible. It is a work-in-progress, open-source manifesto for the self.

Feel free to fork or copy any of this information. If this project interests you, please have a look at the main inspiration for this project, [Codex Virtae](http://wayoftheduck.com/codex-vitae) by [Buster Benson](http://busterbenson.com).

Explanation

All three sections provides an explanation in the [Overview](/lifelong/overview.md) document of what their purpose is, in further detail than documented in this readme. Providing citation and thorough discourse as to *why* things are set up the way they are.

For more information, visit the [Meta](/appendix/meta.md) document, where more of the syntax and rules are established and discussed. There's also supplementary information on how to create your own compass.

If there's anything else you're curious about or you're interested in collaborating with me on this, feel free to [drop me an email](mailto:brennankbrown@outlook.com).

Outline
=======

This outline contains a brief description of each section and every file within compass.

--------
Lifelong
--------

This is the smallest and most important part of compass.

These documents are permanent, and slowly (or quickly) change over the course of your life. They serve the purpose of stating what you currently want your life to be in relevant areas. They provide an easy reference for you to find what you're supposed to be doing when you feel lost, or where you need to improve.

**Codex** — The main document. Briefly put, a detailed self-analysis of your purpose in life and how you affect the world around you.

**Habits** — What habits you believe you should be doing. Sorted by short-term and long-term.

**Summary** — A streamlined version of the Codex and Habits files that can quickly understand things in compression.

-------
Interim
-------

In juxtaposition to the files in the lifelong section, interim are collections of more minor documents from day-to-day life. They consist of anything from quantified data to chronological entries.

**Reviews** — Weekly, monthly and yearly reviews to track and review (duh) events, goals and anything else you find relevant.

**Photos** — Zipped archived of photos taken daily with notes. [Idea taken from here.](http://www.geekwire.com/2012/day-rest-life/)

**Reports** — Information exported from self-quantification devices, services, etc.

--------
Appendix
--------

**License** — What you're able to and aren't able to do with this project.

**Acknowledgements** — Credit where credit is due. Please read.

**Tools** — Helpful tools to help keep track of the important things in life. Both analogue and digital.

**Meta** — Documentation on Project Compass itself. Contains everything you need to know.

**Lexicon** — Major and minor ideas to share and implement into the world.

**Canon** — Recommended media and literature for further reading/viewing/listening/etc. Life-changing work and work related to Project Compass prioritized.

**Archive** — A redundant, compressed archive of the entirety of Project Compass on a yearly basis.
