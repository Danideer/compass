### Reviews

I've had a bit of difficulty regarding the hierarchy for reviews, it's tricky to organize everything without any files being confusing.

This is the structure so far, folders are bolded:

**Review**
-> **2015** (year)
---> 2015-title.md (yearly review)
---> 2015-months.md (monthly reviews, all contained within a single markdown file)
---> **Weekly Reviews**
------> january.md (weekly reviews, all contained within a single markdown file per month)
------> feburary.md
------> march.md
------> etc.md
-> **2016**
---> 2016-title.md
---> 2016-months.md
---> **Weekly Reviews**
------> january.md
------> etc.md
